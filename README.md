# Forcasting
# Sensor Data Forecasting Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for a project focused on analyzing and forecasting sensor data. The project aims to provide insights into the data collected by various sensors and make predictions related to CO2 levels.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Data Analysis

- The initial step involves analyzing the provided dataset.
- The code includes data cleaning steps to handle missing values and duplicates.
- It generates scatterplots and correlation matrices for selected columns to visualize relationships and correlations within the data.

### Task 2: CO2 Forecasting

- The project focuses on forecasting CO2 data.
- It uses the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting.
- The code separates the dataset into a training set and a test set.
- It fits the ARIMA model to the training data and generates predictions for the test data.
- The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions.

### Task 3: Results and Reflection

- After completing the forecasting, the project provides an opportunity for you to discuss and reflect on the results obtained.
- You can analyze the MAE value and any insights gained from the data analysis and forecasting process.
